# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release.

- A quiet plain-text editor for macOS and Linux, drawn by MyGo's native UI:
  no webview, no cgo, one Go binary.
- Projects are ordinary folders. The in-window folder picker, recent
  projects and per-project layouts keep each workspace separate.
- Tabs hold a tile of panes. Splits open an empty pane with an inline file
  search; drag a pane onto another pane's edge to place it there, or move it
  with Option+Shift and the arrows.
- Syntax highlighting for the languages MyGo knows, line numbers for code,
  wrapped prose, and Markdown source or preview.
- Explorer with file operations, in-project search, and Material file icons.
- A real terminal pane backed by a persistent session server; quitting the
  app detaches from shells instead of ending them.
- Git working-tree page with status, per-file diff and change stats.
- An SSH project workflow that mirrors a folder from a host and runs its
  terminals and Git diff there.
- Images and PDFs in a contained viewer, Settings in their own window, light
  and dark palettes, and a command palette over every command.
- Linux builds as per-user tar.gz archives and Debian packages for amd64
  and arm64, beside the macOS disk images.
